# F-shortcut
An application that stores and runs file/folder paths and urls. And it can search the Internet directly too.

Install the components into your desired folder and create a shortcut to the execution on the desktop.

# How to use

- It is advised NOT to modify the data.json file by yourself, the program might crash due to invalid data type.
